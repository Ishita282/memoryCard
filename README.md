# 🧠 Memory Card Game

## 🎯 Objective
A classic **Memory Card Game** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and served locally using **Express.js**.  
The objective of the game is to test your memory by matching pairs of cards. Flip two cards at a time — if they match, they stay flipped; if not, they flip back. Try to complete the game in the fewest moves and shortest time possible!
